#  LLM Code Generation Test: Long Output Generation

![alt text](charts/1.png)

*10-Dec-24*

The purpose of this experiment was to compare and evaluate the capability of different code generation large language models to generate a single long continuous output. 

The prompt used as well as all the outputs are recorded in the data folder. The demanding prompt requested that the LLM assist in the generation of a Open AI Whisper Speech to text transcription GUI for Linux. 

Various large language models were tested across different platforms, including models deployed on Hugging Face, those available via Open Router, and those hosted locally on LM Studio. 

The outputs were recorded in their original form in the outputs folder and a script was used to calculate the character count as well as the percentage of code in the outputs, which was calculated by computing the character count within code fences and comparing that to the total character count in the output. 

Additionally, the number of code blocks within each single output was computed by calculating the number of code blocks in the output. 

Qwen 2.5 Coder generated the longest single output at 13,950 characters, almost 90% of which constituted code spread across five different code blocks.  

Discrepancies between runs on the same platform, and when comparing the same model's output across different access interfaces, were overall quite small. Quen 2.5 when accessed via Open Router via its API yielded an output of 13,159 characters with a code percentage of 82%. This works out to a difference in output length of 5.7 %.

Qwen's larger 72B parameter instruction model generated an output that was almost as long as that of its smaller code specific sibling, 2.5 Coder (12,921 characters, 84% within codefences). 

The lengthiest response among the "Western" models was the one generated by OpenAI's o-1 Preview, accessed via API, which generated 13,622 characters (82% within codefences) and the largest number of unique code blocks at 10.
