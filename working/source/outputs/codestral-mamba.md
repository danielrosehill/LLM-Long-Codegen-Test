To develop a Python-based GUI application for real-time speech-to-text transcription using the OpenAI Whisper API on OpenSUSE Linux, here is a high-level plan to guide you throughout the development process:

1. Setup the Development Environment:
   - Install Python 3 and pip if not already installed.
   - Install virtualenv to create a virtual environment for the project.
   - Create a new virtual environment and activate it: `python3 -m venv venv`, `source venv/bin/activate` (for Linux).
   - Install necessary libraries: `pip install pyaudio keyboard pyperclip keyboard keyring requests pyinstaller`.

2. Design the GUI:
   - Choose a GUI library (e.g., tkinter) and design the main GUI window.
   - Include a section for the API key input and securely store it.
   - Implement a dropdown menu for selecting the microphone.
   - Create two buttons for starting and stopping dictation.
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts for starting and stopping dictation.

3. Implement Audio Input Handling:
   - Use a Python library (e.g., pyaudio) to capture audio from the selected microphone.
   - Process audio into chunks suitable for sending to the OpenAI Whisper API.

4. Integrate with OpenAI Whisper API:
   - Use the OpenAI Whisper API to transcribe audio chunks into text.
   - Handle the API responses efficiently to minimize delay.

5. Implement Text Input Integration:
   - Use a library like `pyperclip` to automate inserting transcribed text into active text fields.

6. Implement Persistent Settings:
   - Use a library like `keyring` to store the API key securely and persistently.
   - Save selected microphone and keyboard shortcuts in a configuration file.

7. Create the System Tray Integration:
   - Hide the main GUI and display a system tray icon on minimizing.
   - Implement right-clicking the tray icon to open a context menu with options: show/hide main GUI.

8. Package the Application:
   - Use a tool like `pyinstaller` to package the Python script into an executable file for Linux.
   - Test the executable on OpenSUSE Linux to ensure everything works as expected.
